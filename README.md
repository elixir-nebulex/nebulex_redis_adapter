## About

This adapter uses [Redix][redix]; a Redis driver for Elixir.

The adapter supports different configurations modes which are explained in the
next sections.

## Installation

Add `:nebulex_redis_adapter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:nebulex_redis_adapter, "~> 3.0.0-rc.1"},
    {:crc, "~> 0.10"},        #=> Needed when using `:redis_cluster` mode
    {:ex_hash_ring, "~> 6.0"} #=> Needed when using `:client_side_cluster` mode
  ]
end
```

The adapter dependencies are optional to give more flexibility and loading only
needed ones. For example:

  * `:crc` - Required when using the adapter in mode `:redis_cluster`.
    See [Redis Cluster][redis_cluster].
  * `:ex_hash_ring` - Required when using the adapter in mode
    `:client_side_cluster`.

Then run `mix deps.get` to fetch the dependencies.

## Usage

After installing, we can define our cache to use Redis adapter as follows:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RedisCache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Redis
end
```

The rest of Redis configuration is set in our application environment, usually
defined in your `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.RedisCache,
  conn_opts: [
    # Redix options
    host: "127.0.0.1",
    port: 6379
  ]
```

Since this adapter is implemented by means of `Redix`, it inherits the same
options, including regular Redis options and connection options as well. For
more information about the options, please check out `Nebulex.Adapters.Redis`
module and also [Redix][redix].

See [online documentation][docs] and [Redis cache example][redis_example]
for more information.

## Distributed Caching

There are different ways to support distributed caching when using
**Nebulex.Adapters.Redis**.

### Redis Cluster

[Redis Cluster][redis_cluster] is a built-in feature in Redis since version 3,
and it may be the most convenient and recommendable way to set up Redis in a
cluster and have a distributed cache storage out-of-box. This adapter provides
the `:redis_cluster` mode to set up **Redis Cluster** from the client-side
automatically and be able to use it transparently.

First of all, ensure you have **Redis Cluster** configured and running.

Then we can define our cache which will use **Redis Cluster**:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RedisClusterCache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Redis
end
```

The config:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.RedisClusterCache,
  # Enable redis_cluster mode
  mode: :redis_cluster,

  # For :redis_cluster mode this option must be provided
  redis_cluster: [
    # Configuration endpoints
    # This is where the client will connect and send the "CLUSTER SHARDS"
    # (Redis >= 7) or "CLUSTER SLOTS" (Redis < 7) command to get the cluster
    # information and set it up on the client side.
    configuration_endpoints: [
      endpoint1_conn_opts: [
        host: "127.0.0.1",
        port: 6379,
        # Add the password if 'requirepass' is on
        password: "password"
      ]
    ]
  ]
```

The pool of connections to the different master nodes is automatically
configured by the adapter once it gets the cluster slots info.

> This one could be the easiest and recommended way for distributed caching
  using Redis and **Nebulex.Adapters.Redis**.

### Client-side Cluster

**Nebulex.Adapters.Redis** also brings with a simple client-side cluster
implementation based on sharding distribution model.

We define our cache normally:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ClusteredCache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Redis
end
```

The config:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.ClusteredCache,
  # Enable client-side cluster mode
  mode: :client_side_cluster,

  # For :client_side_cluster mode this option must be provided
  client_side_cluster: [
    # Nodes config (each node has its own options)
    nodes: [
      node1: [
        # Node pool size
        pool_size: 10,

        # Redix options to establish the pool of connections against this node
        conn_opts: [
          host: "127.0.0.1",
          port: 9001
        ]
      ],
      node2: [
        pool_size: 4,
        conn_opts: [
          url: "redis://127.0.0.1:9002"
        ]
      ],
      node3: [
        conn_opts: [
          host: "127.0.0.1",
          port: 9003
        ]
      ]
      # Maybe more ...
    ]
  ]
```

### Using a Redis Proxy

The other option is to use a proxy, like [Envoy proxy][envoy] or
[Twemproxy][twemproxy] on top of Redis. In this case, the proxy does the
distribution work, and from the adparter's side (**Nebulex.Adapters.Redis**),
it would be only configuration. Instead of connect the adapter against the
Redis nodes, we connect it against the proxy nodes, this means, in the config,
we setup the pool with the host and port pointing to the proxy.

## Using the adapter as a Redis client

Since the Redis adapter works on top of `Redix` and provides features like
connection pools, "Redis Cluster", etc., it may also work as a Redis client.
The Redis API is quite extensive, and there are many useful commands we may
want to run, leveraging the Redis adapter features. Therefore, the adapter
provides additional functions to do so.

```elixir
iex> conn = MyCache.fetch_conn!()
iex> Redix.command!(conn, ["LPUSH", "mylist", "world"])
1
iex> Redix.command!(conn, ["LPUSH", "mylist", "hello"])
2
iex> Redix.command!(conn, ["LRANGE", "mylist", "0", "-1"])
["hello", "world"]

iex> conn = MyCache.fetch_conn!(key: "mylist")
iex> Redix.pipeline!(conn, [
...>   ["LPUSH", "mylist", "world"],
...>   ["LPUSH", "mylist", "hello"],
...>   ["LRANGE", "mylist", "0", "-1"]
...> ])
[1, 2, ["hello", "world"]]
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `:name` may be needed when using dynamic caches, and the `:key` is
> required when using the `:redis_cluster` or `:client_side_cluster` mode.

## Testing

To run the **Nebulex.Adapters.Redis** tests you will have to have Redis running
locally. **Nebulex.Adapters.Redis** requires a complex setup for running tests
(since it needs a few instances running, for standalone, cluster and Redis
Cluster). For this reason, there is a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
file in the repo so that you can use [Docker][docker] and
[docker-compose][docker_compose] to spin up all the necessary Redis instances
with just one command. Make sure you have Docker installed and then just run:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

[docker]: http://www.docker.com/
[docker_compose]: http://docs.docker.com/compose/

Since `Nebulex.Adapters.Redis` uses the support modules and shared tests
from `Nebulex` and by default its test folder is not included in the Hex
dependency, the following steps are required for running the tests.

First of all, make sure you set the environment variable `NEBULEX_PATH`
to `nebulex`:

```
export NEBULEX_PATH=nebulex
```

Second, make sure you fetch `:nebulex` dependency directly from GtiHub
by running:

```
mix nbx.setup
```

Third, fetch deps:

```
mix deps.get
```

Finally, you can run the tests:

```
mix test
```

Running tests with coverage:

```
mix coveralls.html
```

You will find the coverage report within `cover/excoveralls.html`.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks were added using [benchee](http://github.com/PragTob/benchee);
to learn more, see the [benchmarks](./benchmarks) directory.

To run the benchmarks:

```
mix run benchmarks/benchmark.exs
```

> Benchmarks use default Redis options (`host: "127.0.0.1", port: 6379`).
